========

## Introduction
Pastiche is an online artwork community developed using the [Laravel](http://github.com/laravel/laravel "Laravel on GitHub") PHP Framework.

## Requirements
#### Install Composer
[Download](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe "Get Composer") and install composer on your machine.

#### Install Laravel
With composer installed, run the following command in your terminal:
```
composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.2"
```
Next, add laravel to your path. Path is found in System Properties, Advanced System Settings, Environment Variables, System Variables, Path. Click edit, and add the following:
```
%appdata%\Composer\vendor\bin;
```

#### Install GitHub
Are you kidding me?

## Project Setup
#### Install Project
[Clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/outlime/app-lara-test-8 "Clone")  this repository to your machine.
Install the project dependencies by running<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> the following command:
```
composer install
```

#### Configure Environment
Inside your project folder, you can find a `.env` (environment) file. Open it and set up the following variables with their respective values:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=pastichedb
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```
**NOTE:** These are the default values. Change them accordingly if you need to.

#### Create Database
Create a database in `localhost/phpmyadmin`. Name the database `pastichedb` (preferred but not required). Finally, run<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> the following command:
```
php artisan migrate
```

## Developing<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>
#### Running the Project
To run the project, run<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> the following command:
```
php -S localhost:8888 -t public
```
Open your browser and go to `localhost:8888`.

#### Project Directories
 File                | Directory         
:--------------------|:------------
 User Views          | `resources\views`
 Styles              | `public\css`
 Scripts             | `public\js`

#### URLs<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>

 Page                | URL         
:--------------------|:------------
 Home/Dashboard      | `localhost:8888`
 Login               | `localhost:8888/login`

 Logout              | `localhost:8888/logout`

#### Views
Laravel uses a special templating engine for its views. Thus, when creating a new view always save with an extension of `.blade.php`.

The main template for all views is `home.blade.php`

To add a new CSS file:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ URL::asset('css/font-awesome.css') }}">
```
To add a new JS file:
```
<script src="{{ URL::asset('js/jquery.min.js') }}"></script>
```
To add a comment:
```
{{-- This is a comment --}}
```

## FAQ
#### Composer installer asks for a php.exe file. Where is it found?
For WAMP, it is found in `C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.5.12`.

#### When I run a php artisan command, the keyword artisan is not recognized
You are not running the command in your project directory.

#### Why do I not have a .env file?
If you already did `composer install`, you may have to manually make your own by running<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> the following commands:
```
copy .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

#### I am experiencing SQL errors
Your WAMP isn't turned on or isn't configured correctly.

#### I am experiencing a TokenMismatchException
Your session has expired. Reload the page.

#### I have many more questions about Laravel
There is a search engine invented in 1998 called Google.
